# The Anti-Collatz Map: a parity-inverted dual of the 3n+1 rule
**Research note (computational / empirical)**

## Abstract
We study a parity-inverted variant of the classical Collatz map. The classical Collatz function
applies contraction to even integers via `n/2` and expansion to odd integers via `3n+1`. Here we
invert the parity switch and define the **Anti-Collatz** map by:

\[
T_{\text{anti}}(n)=
\begin{cases}
3n+1 & n\equiv 0\pmod{2}\\
\lfloor n/2\rfloor & n\equiv 1\pmod{2}
\end{cases}
\]

Empirically, the resulting dynamical system exhibits behavior qualitatively different from the classical case:
(1) abundant non-trivial cycles, (2) repulsive/global-growth tendencies in many trajectories, and
(3) jump–collapse orbit structure dominated by even-step expansion followed by odd-step contraction cascades.
We provide reproducible code, plots, and cycle detection utilities.

## 1. Background and motivation
The Collatz conjecture concerns the iteration of:
\[
T(n)=\begin{cases}
n/2 & n\equiv 0\pmod{2}\\
3n+1 & n\equiv 1\pmod{2}
\end{cases}
\]
and conjectures that every positive integer eventually reaches the 4→2→1 cycle.

A minimal perturbation is to preserve the two arithmetic operations (divide-by-two and 3n+1) but invert
which parity class receives which operation. This produces a natural “companion” map with notably different dynamics.

## 2. Definition
For integers \(n\ge 1\), define:
- If \(n\) is even: \(n\mapsto 3n+1\)
- If \(n\) is odd:  \(n\mapsto \lfloor n/2\rfloor\)

We refer to this parity-inverted map as **Anti-Collatz** throughout this note.

## 3. Example cycle
A representative non-trivial cycle appears from the seed \(n=6\):
\[
6 \to 19 \to 9 \to 4 \to 13 \to 6.
\]

## 4. Empirical orbit structure
Observed orbits typically alternate between:
- **expansion spikes** triggered at even values (\(3n+1\)),
- **short contraction runs** on odd values (\(\lfloor n/2\rfloor\), often repeated after returning to odd states).

These patterns appear clearly in the trajectory plots reproduced in the accompanying notebook.

## 5. Cycle detection method
We detect cycles by iterating from a seed and recording visited states in a dictionary (hash map).
When a state repeats, the intervening segment is the cycle. This is sufficient for a robust empirical survey.

## 6. Notes on terminology
The phrase “anti-Collatz” is used informally in online discussions for multiple related constructions
(e.g., reverse-step trees or other Collatz-like variants). In this repo, the term is reserved for the
specific parity-inverted map in Section 2.

## 7. Reproducibility
All figures in `figures/` are generated by `notebooks/anti_collatz_exploration.ipynb` and the functions in `anti_collatz.py`.


## 8. Open questions (empirical → theoretical)
This repository treats Anti-Collatz primarily as a computational object. Natural next questions include:

- Growth of the number of distinct cycles detected as the scan bound increases.
- Basin size distribution and whether it stabilizes under scaling.
- Conditions for “quick cycle capture” vs “long transient excursion”.
- Possible analytical constructions of infinite families of cycles.
